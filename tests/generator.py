"""
File meant to ease the map generation for the my_radar EPITECH project.
It has been created for testing purposes but is not meant to cover
every possible edge-case. Use it with care.

This file isn't PEP8 at all, that's because of the portability aspect of
it, as it will be used "as it is", which is a single script file.
E501 has been violated many times, mainly because of the helper method.
It has been kept under 100 chars except in the helper and exceptions
at all times.
E731 is a known issue that has no easy nor elegant workaround.
Every other error is a mistake and you are welcome to submit a PR
or an issue at https://github.com/jclge/my_radar_testing.git

Every single variable, function, method or attribute has a type hint
except for function pointers. If there is any missing, feel free to
fill an issue on the link given above.
